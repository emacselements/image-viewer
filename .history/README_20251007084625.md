# Image Viewer

A powerful, user-friendly image viewer for Linux, written in Python with Tkinter and Pillow. It supports fast navigation, zoom, pan, crop, GIF animation, folder history, copy/move/duplicate/delete, background options, and more.

## Features

- **Image Navigation:** Next/Previous, First/Last, Random, Slideshow, and folder navigation.
- **Zoom & Pan:** Smooth zoom in/out, fit-to-window, pan with mouse or arrow keys, and per-image zoom memory.
- **Animated GIFs:** Full support for animated GIFs with play/pause.
- **Crop Tool:** Crop images interactively and save as new files.
- **Image Operations:** Delete (to trash), duplicate, copy, move, and remove duplicates (via `fdupes`).
- **Folder Management:** Browse folders, history of recent folders, delete entire folder (with safety checks).
- **Backgrounds:** Switch between white, gray, black, or checkered backgrounds for transparency.
- **Customizable UI:** Fullscreen toggle, border toggle, status messages, and keyboard shortcuts for all actions.
- **Persistence:** Remembers last viewed image, zoom/pan per image, and folder/copy/move history.
